V1.0.0

Ever wanna RP a Maid? Here's your chance!

Requirements:
QB-Core
Gabz-Pinkcage Motel MLO
Qb-Target
Common sense for install

Its pretty basic, using qb-target i've made some standard props targetable and you can "clean" and found loot.

If you don't have Gabz Pinkcage Motel, you can use any other prop you do have in your server, and place it in the config location. 

Below are the props i've used.

,,,
        'prop_nigel_bag_pickup',
        'prop_cs_dvd_player',
        'v_res_fa_radioalarm',
        'prop_cs_remote_01',
        'prop_suitcase_01',
        'prop_id_wallet_pickup'
    ,,,

You can add as many items in the config that you want and it will give multiple items.

Just don't put too many because the server side will run that many times and give multiple items
